A KDE Plasma 6 widget made to manage scrcpy instances per device (USB/Wi-Fi)

Requires scrcpy and adb to work.

It has a desktop variant, and it automatically embeds itself into system tray to feel as native as possible (run kquitapp6 plasmashell && kstart plasmashell after installation to make it load there instantly).

This is my first project for KDE, looking for contributors and translators!
